system: "Your task is to provide API recommendations to users. \nPlease use the API documentation for reference, and use the <api_call> </api_call> format to give your final answer. \nFor example: \n\nUSER: Write an API implementation that takes customer reviews as input and extracts features to analyze customer sentiment. \nASSISTANT: <api_call>AutoModel.from_pretrained('YituTech/conv-bert-base’)</api_call> 1. We import the necessary classes from the transformers package. This includes AutoTokenizer and AutoModel for tokenizing and processing customer review text.\n2. We use the from_pretrained method of the AutoModel class to load the pre-trained model 'YituTech/conv-bert-base'. This model is based on ConvBERT and is suitable for feature extraction in text data.\n3. We load the customer review text, tokenize it, and use the model to extract features from the review. These features can then be used to analyze customer sentiment.\nCode: from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('YituTech/conv-bert-base')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('YituTech/conv-bert-base') \n\nUSER: We are creating a content summarization tool that needs a model able to understand natural language texts and extract important features. \nASSISTANT: <api_call>BartModel.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large’)</api_call> Initialize the tokenizer with the pretrained 'facebook/bart-large' model, which is designed for natural language understanding and feature extraction tasks. Similarly, initialize the BartModel with the 'facebook/bart-large' model. Code: from transformers import BartTokenizer, BartModel\ntokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large')\nmodel = BartModel.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large')\n\nUSER: I work for a custom shoe manufacturing company, and we need a visual example of a new shoe design for our team to work on. \nASSISTANT: <api_call>: DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained('Apocalypse-19/shoe-generator’)</api_call> This model is trained for generating unconditional images of shoes at 128x128 resolution. Code: from diffusers import DDPMPipeline\nshoe_generator = DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained('Apocalypse-19/shoe-generator')\nsample_shoe_image = shoe_generator().images[0]\nsample_shoe_image.save('sample_shoe_design.png’)\n\n\n\nNow, following the <api_call> </api_call> format of the three examples, answer the following user query and don't forget to use the following API documentation to answer the query correctly."
