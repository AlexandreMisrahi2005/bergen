For instance, different potato farms, petroleum and natural gas for heating or electricity, or car and bicycle can be substitutes. The relationship between the price of a substitute and the demand for the primary good is positive: a decrease in the substitute's price leads to a decrease in demand for the primary good.

As a castle, it was used by the monarchs for imprisoning people for various reasons, although its primary purpose was not as a prison. The Tower of London evolved over time with several phases of expansion, playing a significant role in English history, and it was also used as a symbol of oppression by some rulers.

In the 1950s, butane became the preferred fuel choice due to its controllable flame and less odor. Modern Zippo lighters usually use butane, which is absorbed by a saturated cloth wick, a rayon \"cotton\" or batting. The fuel is poured into the rayon balls or batting, which absorb it, and a felt piece covers the bottom of the wick to facilitate refueling.
