Background:
Document 1: DMT1-mutant erythrocytes have shortened life span, accelerated glycolysis and increased oxidative stress.: Deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia. We have previously shown that DMT1 deficiency impairs erythroid differentiation and induces apoptosis of erythroid cells. Here we analyzed metabolic processes and survival of mature erythrocytes in order to address potential involvement of erythrocyte defect in the pathophysiology of the disease.
Document 2: Expression of iron transport protein Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) increases in response to maternal iron deficiency anemia in near term to term placenta.: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency disorder in pregnant women. During pregnancy, placental transport protein Divalent metal transporter1 (DMT1) plays a crucial role in transit of iron across placenta. The developing fetus is observed to be immune to anemia despite presence of anemia in the mother. Hence, we planned the present study to explore the effect of maternal IDA on the expression of DMT1 in the placenta.
Document 3: A spontaneous, recurrent mutation in divalent metal transporter-1 exposes a calcium entry pathway.: Divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1/DCT1/Nramp2) is the major Fe(2+) transporter mediating cellular iron uptake in mammals. Phenotypic analyses of animals with spontaneous mutations in DMT1 indicate that it functions at two distinct sites, transporting dietary iron across the apical membrane of intestinal absorptive cells, and transporting endosomal iron released from transferrin into the cytoplasm of erythroid precursors. DMT1 also acts as a proton-dependent transporter for other heavy metal ions including Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Cu(2), but not for Mg(2+) or Ca(2+). A unique mutation in DMT1, G185R, has occurred
Document 4: Mutations in the gene encoding DMT1: clinical presentation and treatment.: Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is the protein that allows elemental iron entry into the duodenal cell. It is expressed ubiquitously and it also allows the iron exit from the endosomes. This protein plays a central role in iron metabolism and it is strictly regulated. Several animal models elucidate its role in physiology. Recently three patients affected with DMT1 deficiency have been described. This recessively inherited condition appears at birth with severe microcytic anemia. Serum markers could be particularly useful to establish a correct diagnosis: high serum iron, normal total
Document 5: Intestinal DMT1 Is Essential for Optimal Assimilation of Dietary Copper in Male and Female Mice with Iron-Deficiency Anemia.: Divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (DMT1) may transport copper, but studies to date on this topic have been equivocal. Previously, an ex vivo experiment showed that intestinal copper transport was impaired in Dmt1-mutant Belgrade rats.

For marketing, each honey must satisfy an internationally valid Codex standard. One of the quality parameters is diastase/amylase activity, which, if lowered, may be compensated for by the addition of foreign amylases. However, the estimation of enzyme activity does not enable identification of artificially added amylases. 45 honey samples were analyzed using label-free nanoLC-MS/MS proteomics. Four honeys were found to contain the

Background:
Document 1: Spliceosomal component PRP-40 is a central regulator of microexon splicing.: Microexons (â‰¤27 nt) play critical roles in nervous system development and function but create unique challenges for the splicing machinery. The mechanisms of microexon regulation are therefore of great interest. We performed a genetic screen for alternative splicing regulators in the C. elegans nervous system and identify PRP-40, a core component of the U1 snRNP. RNA-seq reveals that PRP-40 is required for inclusion of alternatively spliced, but not constitutively spliced, exons. PRP-40 is particularly required for inclusion of neuronal microexons, and our data indicate that PRP-40 is a central regulator
Document 2: Prp40 pre-mRNA processing factor 40 homolog B (PRPF40B) associates with SF1 and U2AF65 and modulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing in vivo.: The first stable complex formed during the assembly of spliceosomes onto pre-mRNA substrates in mammals includes U1 snRNP, which recognizes the 5' splice site, and the splicing factors SF1 and U2AF, which bind the branch point sequence, polypyrimidine tract, and 3' splice site. The 5' and 3' splice site complexes are thought to be joined together by protein-protein interactions mediated by factors that ensure the fidelity of the initial splice site recognition. In this study, we identified and characterized PRPF40B,
Document 3: RBFOX and PTBP1 proteins regulate the alternative splicing of micro-exons in human brain transcripts.: Ninety-four percent of mammalian protein-coding exons exceed 51 nucleotides (nt) in length. The paucity of micro-exons (â‰¤ 51 nt) suggests that their recognition and correct processing by the splicing machinery present greater challenges than for longer exons. Yet, because thousands of human genes harbor processed micro-exons, specialized mechanisms may be in place to promote their splicing. Here, we survey deep genomic data sets to define 13,085 micro-exons and to study their splicing mechanisms and molecular functions. More than 60% of annotated human micro-exons exhibit a high
Document 4: Prp40 and early events in splice site definition.: The alternative splicing (AS) of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is a tightly regulated process through which introns are removed to leave the resulting exons in the mRNA appropriately aligned and ligated. The AS of pre-mRNA is a key mechanism for increasing the complexity of proteins encoded in the genome. In humans, more than 90% of genes undergo AS, underscoring the importance of this process in RNA biogenesis. As such, AS misregulation underlies multiple human diseases. The splicing reaction is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a highly dynamic complex that assembles at or near
Document 5: Prp40 Homolog A Is a Novel Centrin Target.: Pre-mRNA processing protein 40 (Prp40) is a nuclear protein that has a role in pre-mRNA splicing. Prp40 possesses two leucine-rich nuclear export signals, but little is known about the function of Prp40 in the export process. Another protein that has a role in protein export is centrin, a member of the EF-hand superfamily of Ca

Background:
Document 1: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Entrapment Neuropathies.: Entrapment neuropathy is the result of pressure on a peripheral nerve as it passes through a narrow canal that is bounded by stiff tissues. In spite of their ubiquitous nature, they are underdiagnosed, underreported, and sometimes not properly managed, especially in developing countries. Entrapment neuropathies are of various types, but the most common type is carpal tunnel syndrome. Mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of entrapment neuropathies include mechanical compression and nerve ischemia. A clear understanding of the various types and the underlying mechanisms of entrapment neuropathies are invaluable in the decision-making process involved
Document 2: Association between the: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity. In this study, we aimed to clarify the relationships between the
Document 3: Carpal tunnel syndrome.: Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most commonly diagnosed entrapment neuropathy. This review looks at the current body of evidence to help determine optimal practice for the diagnosis and management of this condition.
Document 4: Invited commentary. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathies and is associated with substantial direct medical costs and with economic costs in terms of man day loss and possible continuing disability.
Document 5: Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome.: Carpal tunnel syndrome is the clinical condition resulting from the entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. It has been accepted as the most frequent entrapment neuropathy. The most common symptoms are tingling, numbness, and pain in the hand that may radiate to the forearm or shoulder. There may be weakness and atrophy of the thenar muscles associated with sensory loss in the affected fingers. There is no universally accepted therapy for carpal tunnel syndrome. Surgical treatment is widely preferred to non-surgical or conservative therapies for overtly symptomatic patients, while mild
