Background:
Document 1: Boxed Warnings and Off-Label Use of Allergy Medications: Risks, Benefits, and Shared Decision Making.: The Food and Drug Administration is tasked with evaluating the efficacy and safety of a drug. Despite having a regimented appraisal process in place, safety evidence can emerge during clinical trials as well as from observations and studies conducted after the drug has been on the market, which might require a boxed warning. The boxed warning is the most severe warning that the Food and Drug Administration can give to an approved drug. It is commonly referred to as a Black Box Warning because it is
Document 2: Pimavanserin.: Pimavanserin (ACP-103) is a selective inverse agonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor intended to treat patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). Currently there are no FDA-approved medications in the United States for the treatment of PDP, although on September 2, 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted breakthrough therapy status to pimavanserin, highlighting the unmet need for therapeutics in this class. Most antipsychotic medications worsen motor dysfunction due to dopamine antagonism, and all carry a black box warning for an increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Data from phase II and phase
Document 3: FDA boxed warnings: how to prescribe drugs safely.: Boxed warnings, commonly referred to as "black box" warnings, are issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and featured in the labeling of drugs associated with serious adverse reactions. These safety concerns are typically identified through the Adverse Event Reporting System and the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, which evaluates postmarket safety findings. The most common type of warning is issued when there is a potentially serious adverse effect that must be carefully weighed against the potential benefit of the drug. Warnings are also issued to draw attention to dosing, monitoring
Document 4: Pimavanserin, a novel antipsychotic for management of Parkinson's disease psychosis.: Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) may develop in up to 60% of Parkinson's patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It also correlates with depression and dementia, and can contribute to caregiver stress and burnout. Pimavanserin is the first FDA approved drug for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP. Areas covered: For this review, a MEDLINE literature search (via PubMed) and information provided by ACADIA Pharmaceuticals were used. This review will discuss the pathophysiology and current management of PDP. In addition, this review will focus on
Document 5: The "black box" warning and allergy drugs.: In the past years, several drugs commonly used by allergy specialists have received a "black box" warning added to their package insert at the direction of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A "black box" warning is the highest level of 5 possible warning categories found in the package insert. The FDA has never articulated the basis for "black box" warnings. They generally appear to be based on clinical data, but occasionally can be based on serious animal toxicity. In the last several years, several drugs commonly used by allergists have received recommendations


Question: What does the boxed warning of pimavanserin say?

### Assistant:


LLM Answer:
 In the provided documents, pimavanserin is mentioned in context with its primary use for treating patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). While it does not explicitly state the specific contents of the boxed warning for pimavanserin, it can be inferred that PDP medications, in general, have safety concerns related to worsening motor dysfunction and increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. This safety aspect highlights the necessity for boxed warnings like those found on most antipsychotic medications.

Background:
Document 1: Expression of iron transport protein Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) increases in response to maternal iron deficiency anemia in near term to term placenta.: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency disorder in pregnant women. During pregnancy, placental transport protein Divalent metal transporter1 (DMT1) plays a crucial role in transit of iron across placenta. The developing fetus is observed to be immune to anemia despite presence of anemia in the mother. Hence, we planned the present study to explore the effect of maternal IDA on the expression of DMT1 in the placenta.
Document 2: DMT1-mutant erythrocytes have shortened life span, accelerated glycolysis and increased oxidative stress.: Deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia. We have previously shown that DMT1 deficiency impairs erythroid differentiation and induces apoptosis of erythroid cells. Here we analyzed metabolic processes and survival of mature erythrocytes in order to address potential involvement of erythrocyte defect in the pathophysiology of the disease.
Document 3: Divalent metal-ion transporter 1 is decreased in intestinal epithelial cells and contributes to the anemia in inflammatory bowel disease.: Divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (DMT1) has been found to play an important role in the iron metabolism and hemogenesis. However, little is known about the potential role of DMT1 in the pathogenesis of anemia from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Herein, we investigated expression of DMT1 in the intestinal mucosa by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, and found that DMT1 was significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa of active IBD patients compared with that in those patients
Document 4: Iron handling and gene expression of the divalent metal transporter, DMT1, in the kidney of the anemic Belgrade (b) rat.: We have previously shown that the rat kidney reabsorbs metabolically significant amounts of iron and that it expresses the divalent metal transporter 1, DMT1. The Belgrade (b) rat carries a mutation in DMT1 gene, which causes hypochromic, microcytic anemia due to impaired intestinal iron absorption and transport of iron out of the transferrin cycle endosome. In the duodenum of b/b rats, expression of DMT1 mRNA and protein is increased, suggesting a feedback regulation by iron stores. The aim of this
Document 5: Transport of divalent transition-metal ions is lost in small-intestinal tissue of b/b Belgrade rats.: Belgrade rats exhibit microcytic, hypochromic anemia and systemic iron deficiency due to a glycine-to-arginine mutation at residue 185 in a metal ion transporter of a divalent metal transporter/divalent cation transporter/solute carrier 11 group A member 2 or 3 (DMT1/DCT1/SLC11A2), a member of the natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) family. By use of rabbit duodenal tissue, a calcein fluorescence assay has previously been developed to assess transport of divalent metal ions across the small-intestinal brush border membrane (BBM). The assay was readily applied here to rat BBM to


Question: Could divalent metal transporter 1 deficiency lead to anemia?

### Assistant:


LLM Answer:
Yes, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) deficiency can lead to anemia. In Document 2, it is mentioned that deficiency of DMT1 results in hypochromic microcytic anemia, while Document 4 states that the Belgrade (b) rat, which carries a mutation in the DMT1 gene, suffers from hypochromic, microcytic anemia due to impaired iron absorption and transport. Moreover, the background from Document 1 explains that during pregnancy, the placental transport protein DMT1 plays a crucial role

Background:
Document 1: Validated treatments and therapeutic perspectives regarding nutritherapy.: Nutritherapy seeks to prevent or correct disease by the use of nutritional supplements including vitamins, trace elements, or macronutrients. This chapter of the "Les Entretiens du Carla" reviews the potential of nutritherapy for the prevention or improvement of sarcopenia, which is the progressive reduction in muscle mass and muscle strength prevalent in late-life. It is critical that we review nutrients and their potential to maintain muscle mass and strength which ultimately will help minimize falls and fractures among the older population. Evidence from randomized-controlled trials will be reviewed for muscle mass as well
Document 2: Designing pharmaceutical trials for sarcopenia in frail older adults: EU/US Task Force recommendations.: An international task force of academic and industry leaders in sarcopenia research met on December 5, 2012 in Orlando, Florida to develop guidelines for designing and executing randomized clinical trials of sarcopenia treatments. The Task Force reviewed results from previous trials in related disease areas to extract lessons relevant to future sarcopenia trials, including practical issues regarding the design and conduct of trials in elderly populations, the definition of appropriate target populations, and the selection of screening tools, outcome measures, and biomarkers. They discussed regulatory issues, the
Document 3: Clinical trials on sarcopenia: methodological issues regarding phase 3 trials.: Phase 3 trials estimate the effectiveness of an intervention to prevent, delay the onset of, or treat sarcopenia. Participants should have sarcopenia or present a sarcopenia risk profile. Control group should be characterized by the best standard of clinical care. This article further develops issues on sarcopenia definition, target population, primary and secondary end points, duration of the trials, muscle mass assessment, strength and physical performance assessment, and control of possible confounders. The challenges to conduct phase 3 trials in the elderly should not offset the opportunities for the development
Document 4: [The Relationship between Sarcopenia and Survival after Cabazitaxel Treatment for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer].: Sarcopenia is a known predictor of overall survival in several diseases. We investigated the relationship between sarcopenia and outcome of treatment with cabazitaxel (CBZ) for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by a retrospective analysis of 37 patients, who were given cabazitaxel at our hospital, from December 2014 to November 2020. The skeletal muscle mass was evaluated using the Psoas Muscle Mass Index (PMI: psoas major muscle area at the level of the third lumber vertebra (cm²)/height x height (m²)) through computed tomography images. The severe sarcopenia group (PMI＜4.96)
Document 5: Considerations in the development of drugs to treat sarcopenia.: Sarcopenia describes reduced skeletal muscle mass and impaired muscle function associated with aging and with a variety of chronic diseases prevalent in the aging population. With increasing understanding of the molecular pathways participating in the structural and functional changes affecting skeletal muscle in these conditions, a number of potential targets for pharmacological interventions to reverse sarcopenia have been identified. The clinical evaluation of therapeutic candidates directed at these targets will require that the efficacy and safety of the drug candidates be adequately evaluated to meet the regulatory standards of the Food

Background:
Document 1: Hearing loss in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia.: Achondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate skeletal dysplasia. The condition is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, affecting endochondral bone growth, including the craniofacial anatomy. Recurrent otitis media infections, chronic middle ear effusion, and hearing loss are common in children with achondroplasia, but few studies have investigated hearing loss in adults with this condition.
Document 2: High-resolution computed tomography temporal bone imaging in achondroplasia.: Achondroplasia is a genetic condition caused by disordered endochondral ossification, which leads to rhizomelic dwarfism and midfacial hypoplasia. Additionally, several morphologic changes in the temporal bone are thought to at least partially contribute to hearing loss in these patients. We present a patient with achondroplasia who presented with hearing loss and was referred to radiology for temporal bone imaging. High-resolution computed tomography of temporal bones demonstrated several interesting morphological abnormalities characteristic of achondroplasia.
Document 3: Otologic impairments in achondroplasia: a nosologic assessment.: The AA report a clinical and radiological study performed in 18 achondroplastic patients in order to achieve a nosological settlement of the otological impairments. They found two main otological syndromes; one, a congenital dysplasic syndrome, showing permanent conductive or sensory-neural hearing loss due to malformations of the middle ear or of the inner ear; the other, an inflammatory tubal tympanic syndrome with transient conductive hearing loss, which is relatively frequent in achondroplastic patients, but seems not related to the main disease.
Document 4: Hearing loss and temporal bone structure in achondroplasia.: Characteristic temporal bone changes have recently been defined by high resolution CT in nine patients with achondroplasia (Cobb et al., Am J Neuroradiol 9:1195, 1988). These included narrowing of the skull base and "towering" petrous ridges resulting in abnormal orientation of the inner and middle ear structures. In order to determine whether these morphologic changes are the cause of the hearing deficit in achondroplasia, audiometric studies and ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients. All had a history of frequent otitis media and four had experienced tympanic membrane tube
Document 5: Bilateral ossiculoplasty in 1 case of achondroplasia.: Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and it combines various complications with normal longevity. Hearing disturbance due to otitis media or an ossicular anomaly is one of the most common complications. Conductive hearing loss is suggested as the most common form of hearing loss. Temporal bone and middle ear structures are distorted in achondroplasia because of rotational change of the skull base. Authors experienced a case of an achondroplastic patient with bilateral hearing disturbance. We faced making a potential mistake during the previous operation but a favorable postoperative result occurred. Our experience


Question: Is Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?

### Assistant:


LLM Answer:
 Yes, Achondroplasia, a genetic condition causing disproportionate skeletal dysplasia, is associated with hearing loss. Several documents point out the connection between Achondroplasia and hearing issues. It results from recurrent otitis media infections, chronic middle ear effusion, morphological abnormalities in the temporal bone, and deformities in the middle and inner ear structures. Studies have shown that both congenital malformation-related and inflammation-related hearing loss are prevalent in patients with Achondroplasia.

Document 1: Triiodothyronine (T3) toxicosis with hypokalemic periodic paralysis.: A case of triiodothyronine (T3) toxicosis associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis is reported. Thyrotoxic manifestation was minimal except for mild struma. Serum T3 levels were moderately elevated, though other thyroid function tests were within the normal range. The patient was treated with methimazole, and paralytic attacks ceased. This is the first report of this combination and the necessity of careful thyroid function tests in sporadic periodic paralysis is emphasized.
