    "    \"Document 2: Jamie Lee Curtis |  Jamie Lee Curtis (born November 22, 1958) is an American actress and writer. She is the recipient of several accolades, including a British Academy Film Award, two Golden Globe Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998. Curtis made her film acting debut as Laurie Strode in John Carpenter's horror film Halloween (1978), which established her as a scream queen, and she thereafter appeared in a string of horror films, including The Fog, Prom Night, Terror Train (all 1980) and Roadgames (1981). She reprised the role of Laurie in the sequels Halloween II (1981), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), Halloween: Resurrection (2002), Halloween (2018), and Halloween Kills (2021). Her filmography is largely characterized by independent film that have been box-office successes, with 8 of her lead-actress credits \",\n",

Featured were George Hearn as Max and Judy Kuhn as Betty. Lloyd Webber had reworked both the book and score, tightening the production, better organising the orchestrations, and adding the song \"\"Every Movie\\'s a Circus\"\". This new production was better received by the critics and was an instant success, running for 369 performances. The Los Angeles production also recorded a new cast album that is well regarded. It is also the only unabridged cast recording of the show, since the original London recording was trimmed by over thirty minutes. A controversy arose with this production after Faye Dunaway was hired to replace Glenn Close. Dunaway went into rehearsals with Rex Smith as Joe and Jon Cypher as Max. Tickets \"',\n",
